This branch of the code represents the state of the code at submission to IDETC.

In order for the model code to work, download Qprop and add the executable (Qprop.exe) to the base directory. 

Simulated annealing and genetic algorithm comparisons use MATLAB's functions, so make sure to have MATLAB's optimization toolboxes installed.

To test the multiagent-based method, open and run main. 

To test the other methods, open and run GA_Experiment and SA_experiment.
